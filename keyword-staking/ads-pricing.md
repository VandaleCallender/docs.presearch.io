# ðŸ“¦ ADs Pricing - How much does it cost to advertise on Presearch ?

Now, for just 0.066% per day, or about 2% per month, your keyword ad can guarantee you a prime spot at the top of the search results page.

To activate subscription you just have to check the box as shown in the image below.

</div>

**Note:** If you don't want to pay the fee, you can uncheck the subscription box but your ad will remain at the bottom of the search results.

Additionally, if you have the box active but do not have enough Pre in your Pre wallet to pay the daily amount, you will lose the privilege of appearing at the top of the results and the ad will be placed at the bottom automatically.

The charge will be made daily to your Pre Wallet so make sure you have enough Pre there to cover the fees.

You can check the deduction here:
