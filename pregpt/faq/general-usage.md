## Can I customize PreGPT ?

Where it says system prompt, type in a set of instructions or context that you'd like the AI to follow. Hit enter of simply wait and the system prompt will be guiding your chats going forward by default. This can include specifying a particular tone, such as formal, casual, or humorous, or directing the AI to adopt a certain role, like a tutor, advisor, or storyteller. This way, you can tailor the conversation to better suit your needs or preferences.

## What if I encounter any errors ?

If you run into any issues, try refreshing the page or initiating a new chat session. Occasionally, there will be network outages as well.
