# AI model limitations

## What are the limitations of PreGPT ?

Like all chatbots, PreGPT has its boundaries. It does not provide real-time or web-based information and operates with knowledge up until roughly Spring 2023, when the Mistral 7B training data ended.  The current LLM model primarily supports English, with limited capabilities in other languages.

## What about AI hallucinations ?

PreGPT, on occasion, may produce clearly incorrect or irrelevant responses. This phenomenon, known as "AI hallucination," is due to factors like limited training data or inherent biases.  When experienced, try to clarify your prompt.
