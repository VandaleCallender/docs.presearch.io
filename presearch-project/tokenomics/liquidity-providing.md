# Liquidity Providing

## How to provide liquidity?

Liquidity can be provided in a few easy steps:

1.  [Visit Presearch (PRE) on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xf248959d7aa50cd47b448f507063eaa6cc5404c4) and click on ‘[+ Add Liquidity](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/ETH/0xec213f83defb583af3a000b1c0ada660b1902a0f)’ in the top right corner.\

2. Add the number of PRE/ETH or PRE/USDT (equivalent in value) you’d like to add to the liquidity pool.
3. Approve spending for PRE/ETH on Uniswap, after this smart contract interaction has been approved, click on: ‘Supply’
4. That’s it, you’re now a liquidity provider for Presearch on Uniswap!

## What are the risks and benefits of providing liquidity?

Providing liquidity on Uniswap comes with volatility risk. If you’re inexperienced, we’d like to recommend you to [read about Uniswap pools](https://defiprime.com/uniswap-liquidity-pools) before doing so. Based on supply and demand, the pool changes and you could end up with a different ETH/PRE or USDT/PRE balance.

Providing liquidity also comes with benefits. Uniswap charges 0.3% transaction fees which liquidity providers share among the total pool. That being said, the more liquidity you provide, the bigger your pool share, the bigger % of total trading fees you receive.

## Benefits for the project

By having more liquidity, PRE will be more accessible for larger clients, traders and new token holders.&#x20;
