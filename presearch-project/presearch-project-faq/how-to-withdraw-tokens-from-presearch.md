# How to withdraw tokens from Presearch?

With the advent of Web3 withdrawals, we are excited to enable our users unencumbered access to all node rewards, user deposited tokens and PRE purchased on the Presearch Platform. Although search rewards will still need to go through a manual review process for some users,  users who search normal (aren't trying to farm tokens from searching) won't have any issues removing their search reward tokens.

If you're looking for how to claim your search rewards token, click the link to the page below!

## Web3 Withdrawl Process

First things first, head to [https://account.presearch.com/withdrawals](https://account.presearch.com/withdrawals) and select the amount of tokens you want to withdraw, the wallet address you want to send the funds to, the network you want to withdraw ETH to, or BASE and the 2FA code. When everything looks good, click withdraw. Make sure the wallet address is a Metamask wallet or some other form of wallet where you can sign transactions. Withdrawing directly to the exchanges will not work. Make sure you have enough ETH in the wallet you send your PRE to depending on the chosen network ETH or BASE. To estimate costs, check current [network congestion & gas costs Eth](https://etherscan.io/gastracker), [network congestion base](https://tokentool.bitbond.com/gas-price/base).

If you've recently un-staked tokens, you'll need to wait the 24hr lockup period before you can withdraw tokens.

### Once you click confirm, an email will be sent to you.&#x20;

Head over to your email to confirm the withdrawl. This is to protect you in case your account is compromised at any time, so that tokens are not able to be withdrawn.

### Once your wallet is connected, click confirm withdrawal.

Be cautious, as this will be your last opportunity to cancel your withdrawal. If you do not wish to proceed with the withdrawal at this point, cancel your withdrawal.
